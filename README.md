# AutoPunchsrc v1.0

Welcome to **AutoPunch**, the tool designed for Best Buy employees tired of going through the long and boring punch-in/punch-out process of TLC.  With **AutoPunch**, you press one button and the rest is done for you.

## iOS Installation

### XCode
**AutoPunch** isn't on the App Store, that would cost me money and I don't feel like spending $99 just to upload a simple application.  To install **AutoPunch** onto your phone, *you need to have a working MacOS environment*.  That could be a hackintosh, it could be a MacBook or an iMac, or it could be a VM.  Basically anything will work as long as you have a MacOS distribution, and XCode installed.  Once you meet the requirements, you can download the XCode project [here](https://github.com/ShermanZero/AutoPunchsrc).  Simply open it up in XCode, and build the project to your phone.
